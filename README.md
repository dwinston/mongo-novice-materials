## Setting up a virtualenv for lesson development
The `env/` directory is `.gitignore`d, so you can do the following to get started:

```bash
# assumes you have python and the virtualenv package installed,
# e.g. via `pip install virtualenv`
# From this repository's root directory:
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done.
