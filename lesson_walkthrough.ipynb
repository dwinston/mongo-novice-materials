    "This lesson introduces MongoDB, a document-oriented database that departs from the relational nature of SQL. Because SQL is so well-established and prevalent as a database technology, the terms \"relational database\" and \"SQL\" are often synonymous. Furthermore, the term \"NoSQL\" has come to encompass a whole class of database technologies that are non-relational in nature. There are other \"NoSQL\" technologies such as key-value stores and column stores that differ from MongoDB's document/collection approach, but we will only cover MongoDB today.\n",

The example data for this lesson is from the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org), which hosts computed information for tens of thousands of known and predicted inorganic crystalline compounds."
